					 At Webster University, we value academics and intellectual growth. Our degree structure encourages students to explore diverse interests. It typically takes four years to complete a bachelor’s degree, with approximately half of all courses being in their chosen major, and the other half giving an opportunity to earn an emphasis, minor, or certificate. Webster students have the opportunity to earn an American, internationally-recognized degree that has prepared them for global perspectives while pushing for personal excellence
